<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Coursework</h2>
<p>Each student has to complete 11 graduate philosophy courses. As well there are some distribution requirements, of which the three most important are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A logic course (typically PHIL 413 or PHIL 414)</li>
<li>A course on ancient philosophy (i.e., figures from before about 600 CE)</li>
<li>A course on modern philosophy (i.e., figures from about 1625-1875 CE)</li>
</ul>
<p>Courses with numbers 400 or above count as graduate courses. 400-level courses are largely undergraduate courses, and may have as many as 50 undergraduates in them. It would be very bad to only take 400-level courses. Still, they count and the optimal number of such courses to take is probably 2-5. They are especially valuable for filling distribution requirements, or for getting a background in areas that your prior education was weak in.</p>
<p>Whether a course number starts with 5 or 6 doesn’t as a rule say much about its content. Traditionally 500-level courses were more survey-ish and 600-level courses more advanced, but this is not at all a reliable guide these days.</p>
<p>Students who have taken graduate courses as part of a graduate degree can apply to have those courses count towards the 11 courses, and/or towards the distribution requirements. There is a limit of 4 courses that can be counted this way. On average, students with Masters degrees have been credited with 1-2 courses from their prior degree, and students who started a PhD elsewhere have been credited 3-4 courses. But these are not a guide to future practice; I mainly state them to let students with a Masters degree not to expect 4 course waivers.</p>
<p>The aim of this stage is to <strong>finish the coursework</strong> and develop the skills and knowledge you need for the subsequent stages.</p>
<p>During this stage you will have a <strong>cohort advisor</strong>. They should meet with you (at least) <strong>three</strong> times per year: once per semester to discuss courses and once around late April to discuss summer plans. In many cases it will be a good idea for the cohort advisor to set up 1 meeting per year (or more) with a specialist on your area, so they can check that you’re preparing properly for research in that area.</p>
<p>You should spend most of this time here in Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>There is no need to send papers out for possible publication, and in fact we mildly discourage this.</p>
<p>You should attend some conferences outside Ann Arbor, and even, especially if they are graduate conferences, presenting at some of them. At the very least, you should present one paper you’ve written to a group here at UM, either a reading group or a graduate student discussion group.</p>
