<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Finishing the Research Program</h2>
<p>This stage is relatively easy to describe: you finish writing a thesis. There are broadly speaking two kinds of theses.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A number of self-contained papers on a somewhat common theme.</li>
<li>Something like a monograph, with one chapter following from the previous one.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice these are less differences than you might think. Some theses under option 1 have a very common theme; some monographs have some big jumps between chapters. My personal preference is for option 2; I think that has been more effective on the job market, but I don’t think everyone agrees with this preference.</p>
<p>Either way, the length of a thesis is 3-4 substantial research articles. In practice, that’s around thirty to forty thousand words. (Though there isn’t really an upper bound.)</p>
<p><em>Write a thesis</em> seems like a big ask, but in practice it is often easier than the previous two stages. If you have a paper and plans for 1-2 more, actually writing two isn’t the hardest thing. Developing the capacity to write papers on topic X can be the big step; exercising that capacity isn’t always as difficult.</p>
<p>Many students, perhaps most, will be trying to get academic jobs during this stage. And I’ll have a lot more to say about the academic job market in later parts of these notes.</p>
<p>The aim of this stage is to <strong>write a thesis</strong> and, if you are on the academic jobs track, <strong>get an academic job</strong>.</p>
<p>During this stage you will be advised by <strong>your thesis advisor</strong>. You should meet them every <strong>1-2 weeks</strong> during term, and virtually meet some times over summer. You should also interact some of the time with the other members of your <strong>thesis committee</strong>. As the thesis takes shape, many people will change the committee members to better fit their interests; some will also change their advisor.</p>
<p>During this time you should primarily be in Ann Arbor, though travelling to conferences (and possibly during summer) should still happen.</p>
<p>Now you should be sending out papers for publication. The paper in your dossier could be published, and it is often a reasonable idea to send out the other papers in your thesis as soon as they are written.</p>
<p>There is less need to go to graduate student conferences now, but you should be trying to go to conferences on your specialised topic, and presenting your best work in best places you can. Especially if you are going on the academic job market, you’ll often be judged on your presentations, so practice them a lot.</p>
