<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Starting The Research Program</h2>
<p>The next stage is to develop a <strong>dossier</strong> and a <strong>prospectus</strong>. In practice, what that means is that you have to write two things.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A chapter of your thesis, which in most cases will be a standalone research paper.</li>
<li>A plan for the rest of the thesis.</li>
</ol>
<p>During this time, you will do what’s called a <strong>Dossier Reading Course</strong>. The name is misleading; what this means in practice is that you’re starting thesis research.</p>
<p>But for most students, this does not mean aiming at a thesis. Rather, it means writing a good paper. This is both feasible, and in practice a good way to actually end up writing a thesis. (But check with your advisor whether this is good advice for the particular subject you’re working on.)</p>
<p>How to get started on research is one of the hardest questions about how to be a graduate student, and there are a lot of things in the rest of this document about how to manage this.</p>
<p>One thing that is distinctively hard about this time is that for possibly the first time since you started elementary school, you won’t have a daily schedule, and you won’t have any deadlines (except self-imposed deadlines) less than one year away. So your work environment will change completely, and you’ll be doing a radically different kind of work to what you had previously done. Managing these two transitions is a challenge.</p>
<p>The aim of this stage is to <strong>write a paper and a thesis plan</strong>.</p>
<p>During this stage you will an <strong>advisor</strong> that you select. While you are officially taking the DRC, this will be the DRC advisor you select. In most cases this person will become the <strong>chair</strong> of your <strong>thesis committee</strong>. During term, you should meet with this person <strong>every 1-2 weeks</strong>. You should also have a <strong>thesis committee</strong> consisting of (at least) two other people in this department, and one person from elsewhere in the university. You should meet with these people at least 1 time every semester or so.</p>
<p>This is the best time to travel as widely as possible. If it is feasible given your research and financial/personal situation, you should spend a semester elsewhere to experience what other departments are like. If it is possible, you should try to spend the summers outside North America.</p>
<p>There is still no need to be sending papers out for publication, but it is no longer discouraged.</p>
<p>But similar to the advice about travel, you should be actively attending conferences at this time. And you should take every opportunity to present <em>the paper</em> either at UM or elsewhere.</p>
